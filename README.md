# Database-Project
ABC SQLite Database Project
Description
This project is a database implementation using SQLite3. The database is named "ABC.sqlite" and includes proper SQL statements to create the required tables in the database and set all the necessary constraints (e.g. primary key, foreign key, and value constraints). The SQL statements for creating the database are located in the "crtdb.sql" text file.

The database includes 5 records inserted into each table. The SQL statements for inserting data are located in the "insdb.sql" text file.

We, as the collaborators have included a "README.txt" file to document the work allocation of each team member.

A PDF file named "Schemas.pdf" is included in the project, which contains screenshots of the structure of all the tables. The project referred to the SQLite Description Table while setting it up.

The project is divided into four parts, which are uploaded to the corresponding folder in GitHub.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, download or clone the project from GitHub. You will need to have SQLite3 installed to run the SQL statements.

To create the database, run the SQL statements in "crtdb.sql". This will create the necessary tables and set the constraints.

To insert data into the tables, run the SQL statements in "insdb.sql". This will insert 5 records into each table.

Usage
To use the database, run SQL queries to retrieve data from the tables. Examples of queries can be found in the "Schemas.pdf" file.
